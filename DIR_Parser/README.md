# Directory structure analyser

This is the directory parser, this will understand the current directory system (hopefully pretty fast) and store it in a relevant format. It's not going to read your files, its just going to read the entire directory format, as in, how your laptop is structured.

It will read that, and then use it to perform file operations.
